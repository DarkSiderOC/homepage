#### Chrome users
When setting this page as your local homepage with Chrome it won't work. I suggest you [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) that not only will display your home page correctly but will also focus the search bar by default, so your productivity won't be affected ðŸš€
